```{r setup, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path = 'python3', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

Here are a few lines of R code.  For some reason the `a` is showing up with some really weird styling.

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 2
c <- a + b
c
```

And here are a few lines of Python, just to test whether the syntax highlighting looks good. 

```{python}
def say_hi(name):
    print("Hello,", name)
    return 1 + 2
    
say_hi("World")
```

Let's test a `knitr::kable`:

```{r}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 10), caption = "Cool caption"
)
```

And some sort of plot:

```{r}
iris <- tbl_df(iris)
iris %>% ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Species))
```

Looks good up to this point!
