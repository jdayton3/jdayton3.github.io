```{r setup, echo=F}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(engine.path = 'python3')
```

Some lines of R code.  For some reason the `a` is showing up with some really weird styling.

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 2
c <- a + b
c
```

And a few lines of Python, just to test whether the syntax highlighting looks good. 

```{python}
def say_hi(name):
    print("Hello,", name)
    return 1 + 2
    
say_hi("World")
```
