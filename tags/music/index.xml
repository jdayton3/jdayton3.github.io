      <description>Justification (Background) For Christmas one year while I was in elementary school, my next-door neighbor got a GameCube from Santa Claus, and he gave me his old Nintendo 64 along with all his games. I was in heaven.
I would play Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 for hours and hours (until I got a C+ in my 6th grade English class and my mom took it away). I didnâ€™t have a memory card, so I had to leave the game running overnight for several days in order to make it to the later levels of the game.</description>
